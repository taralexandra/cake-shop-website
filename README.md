# This README file is linked to a personal project "Cake Shop" :ledger:

My goal here was to make my first HTML & CSS project by my own, using a picture as an inspiration for the design (pinterest).

## The inspiration i used :

[Link to the image on Pinterest](https://fr.pinterest.com/wordpresswebdesign0784/woocommerce-website-designs/)

The image is also available in this repository => [Link to the image i saved](https://github.com/taralexandra/cake-shop-website/blob/main/screen-pinterest-cake-shop.png)

## My process here :

I managed to do most of the content by my own, i only had to ask some help for some details so i am pretty happy with the result. I also wanted to add some "hover" mouse events to practice what i have learned on the last month. I know one of the pictures is not displaying "that" perfect but we always can make something better, right ? The idea here was to practice and progress while having fun so the real goal is a success.

I know this will be my last add to github for 2024, since we are on 30th of December and i am joyfull to add this fun and pretty project. :sparkles: :blush:

Hope you will give a warm welcome to this nice homepage webdesign. :blush:
